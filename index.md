## Getting Around 
{:toc}

The main screen comprises three areas: a center 'work' area, media sidebar, and a menu panel.

![Server Main Screen](/observer/img/mainscreen.jpg ){: .screenshot} 

<a name="cwa"></a>
The __centre work area__ is the main window workspace.  This is where users can create play lists, add and edit media, schedule shows, update system settings, install modules and manage users.  In the example above, a *Schedule* is loaded into the main window workspace.

To the right of the center 'work' area is the __sidebar__ , comprising two tabs, `Media` and `Playlists`, as well as a `Preview` window. Users can toggle between tabs and perform dynamic searches to filter a list of items based on a metadata query. One or more items from the list may be selected. Actions triggered by clicking on buttons below the list operate on selected items. Additional functions  are available by right clicking on items in the list.  To preview items (any supported media including audio, image or video), simply drag and drop any media into the `Preview` window above the sidebar tabs. At the bottom of the sidebar, the number of items in the (filtered) list is shown.

Along the bottom of the screen is the __menu panel__. Depending on user permissions some menus will remain hidden.

## Media

OpenBroadcaster allows media of different types (audio, video, images) to be managed within a single catalogue or media library.  Using radio buttons admins can select which formats the system will accept and recognize.  If media is tried to be uploaded that isn't supported, then it will not be allowed to be added to the library.  Files are screened a number of ways for authenticity including MD5 checksum.  Renaming a text file to *.mp3 will not be accepted.

The `MY` button when selected filters to only show media created and uploaded by user.

### Metadata 

![Upload Details Screen](/observer/img/uploadDetails.jpg ){: .lowres} 

If available, ID3 data are automatically entered into the upload form, otherwise, enter the __Artist__ , __Title__ , along with other known metadata for each file. For metadata common to all items, the `Copy to All` button may be used to facilitate data entry. Use the __Category__ item to facilitate use of Station ID or Priority Broadcasts messages in [Playlists](#playlist).

Depending on permissions, user may or may not be able to set the *is media approved* flag. If not then the media will remain in an 'awaiting approval' queue until the Moderator approves it for inclusion in the music library. A *Status* of 'Public' will allow others to include the selection in their own Playlists. Private media will not be available for other users to browse. *Dynamic Selection* should be enabled for media such as music and station IDs, so that these items are accessible as Dynamic Playlist selections.

Once metadata have been entered, `Save` the items in the queue to add them the library. Incompatible file formats are flagged, and will not be processed in the upload queue.

### Uploading

![Media Upload Screen](/observer/img/uploadMedia.jpg ){: .screenshot}

Items are filtered to displayed only items to which the current user has permission, those which are marked as approved(`ap`), or further restricted to include only those media owned(`my`) by that user. With additional privileges, searches may also be conducted on archived(`ar`) or unapproved(`un`) media. Deleted media items go into a special directory called Archive.  Authorized users are able to go into this archive, purge delete the actual media from the file system, or restore the media back to the library. The active filter is indicated by the use of uppercase notation (e.g. `AP`).

1. Edit or create new Playlist.

1. At bottom of PL, click Add Dynamic Segments

### Default Play List (DPL)

<br/>

### View Details 

![Playlist Details](/observer/img/PlayList_Details.png ){: .screenshot}

<br/>

## Schedules

![Schedule Grid](/observer/img/schedule_grid.jpg ){: .screenshot} 

Server schedule grid portrays a week of programming, with shaded, titled blocks indicating the content spanning those dedicated timeslots.  Hover the cursor over a program block to view a summary of the scheduled show. Double-clicking a block accesses Show editor, if the current user's permissions allow this.

<br/>

### Media and Shows

Schedule a single piece of media or a Playlist (Show) or External Line IN Audio source.

Duration is automatically calculated for individual media tracks and estimated for `dynamic segments`. 

DPL (Default Play List) assigned to that Player automatically starts to avoid dead air filling gaps with dynamic music segments. eg. 60 minute slot containing 50 minutes of programming, DPL will fill to top of the hour for next Time slot.

Flexible methods to schedule media and shows listed in ease of task.

1. Upload media. Drag to schedule and set to play in a time slot.

1. Select uploaded media and drag into an existing scheduled Playlist.

1. Priority function to play every N seconds.  Set start and stop dates. Use sparingly.  Only 1 priority media may run simultaneous per player.

__NB CAP Emergency Alerts automatically override all schedules, currently playing media and internal priority broadcasts. 

The date/time of  timeslots available for scheduling by any user are based on group permissions associated with that users profile. Permissions are managed by the `Administrator` group, although this may be delegated to another group. Only one Player may be scheduled at a time, although a Player may act as `Parent` to one or more players for scheduling. See [Advanced Scheduling](#adv_admin).

![Schedule Time slot](/observer/img/schedule_timeslot.jpg ){: .screenshot} 

Open the schedule grid using the `schedules->schedule shows` menu option:

1. Select the Player you have permission to schedule for. 
1. Move the schedule grid to the desired week, using `<Prev` and `Next>` navigation aids.
1. Display the Playlist Tab in the sidebar.
1. Drag a Playlist from the sidebar onto the schedule.
1. Select from the available timeslots. Start time/date and duration are fixed to the time slot.
1. __Save__ .

If the new show conflicts with any scheduled show, an error will be displayed and the new show will not be saved. Review the schedule. Look for an open time slot, advancing to the following week(s) if necessary. 

Shows must be scheduled with adequate lead-time in order to be synchronized with a Player for broadcast. Allow at least __30 minutes lead time__ to ensure scheduled media can be uploaded to the Player before show time. Sufficient lead time is required to account for  `Show Lockout Time` on the destination Player.

<br/>

### Scheduling Permissions

User with advance permissions can drag Media, Playlist or a Program and override basic users time-slots.    If a slot is already scheduled, advanced user can remove or edit spots they are trying to program.

Advance users can have access to many options including, start and stop of time and date, duration.
Scheduling Mode is available with options for daily, weekly, monthly as well as every x, day, week month

<br/>

### Priority Broadcasts

![Priority Broadcasts](/observer/img/Priority_Broadcasts.png ){: .screenshot}

Users may create an account from a link on the Welcome page. This may also be disable if you do not want public to sign up for new accounts in `User Admin`.

Only one registration is allowed at any given email address. Users are notified of a new, random password by email, upon registration or when a password reminder is requested. Once a user has registered, a notice is sent to the __Administrator__ . Until a user is assigned to a group, they are limited to read only browse/preview of the media library. 

The `admin` user has access to all media, playlists and schedules. As new users are added, they are assigned to a group with the appropriate set of permissions. For example, a `guest` user may browse, but not add/edit/delete items in the media library.

Additional groups may be created for granting users' permission to upload and/or download media, schedule PlayLists, or view playlogs. For example, approval for media and allocation of time slots could be delegated to a group that grants permissions on only one Player device, and has no other administrative privileges. [Advanced Admin](#adv_admin) functions establish hooks for remote Player connections.
